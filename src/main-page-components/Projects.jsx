              Project &quot;FaroMayDay&quot; is an autonomous armoured vehicle
              for transporting wounded people. It is modern solution for
              military. The project depicts a 2.5m x 1m x 1m autonomous
              land-based tracked vehicle designed to evacuate soldiers from the
              battlefield in a quick and unobtrusive manner. The wounded will be
              loaded aboard the vehicle using a mechanism that works on the
              principle of a production belt used in factories or airports. With
              its help, the wounded will also be seated on the on-board bed. The
              vehicle will have a built-in GPS, with the help of which it will
              determine its current location, and computer vision algorithms
              will be used to detect obstacles. By combining these technologies,
              the robot will be able to maneuver smoothly and navigate through
              difficult terrain. The robot&apos;s base speed will be about 70
              kph, and its weight will be 1,500 kg.
